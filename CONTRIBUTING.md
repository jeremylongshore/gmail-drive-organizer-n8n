Thanks for your interest in contributing! This project welcomes contributions from everyone, whether you're fixing a typo, adding a feature, or improving documentation.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

If you find a bug or have a suggestion:

1. **Search existing issues** to avoid duplicates
2. **Open a new issue** with a clear title and description
3. **Include details**:
   - n8n version
   - Workflow version
   - Steps to reproduce (for bugs)
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Error messages or screenshots

### Suggesting Features

We love new ideas! To suggest a feature:

1. **Check existing issues** to see if it's already proposed
2. **Open a feature request** with:
   - Clear description of the feature
   - Use case or problem it solves
   - Any implementation ideas you have
   - Examples of similar features (if applicable)

### Submitting Changes

#### Before You Start

1. **Fork the repository** to your GitHub account
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/[repo-name].git
   cd [repo-name]
   ```
3. **Create a branch** for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

#### Making Changes

1. **Test your changes** in n8n:
   - Import the modified workflow
   - Test all nodes and connections
   - Verify the workflow executes correctly
   - Check edge cases and error handling

2. **Update documentation** if needed:
   - README.md for user-facing changes
   - setup-guide.md for configuration changes
   - Comments in the workflow for complex logic

3. **Follow workflow best practices**:
   - Use descriptive node names
   - Add notes to complex nodes
   - Handle errors gracefully
   - Keep credentials separate from the workflow

#### Testing Checklist

Before submitting, verify:

- [ ] Workflow imports without errors
- [ ] All nodes are properly connected
- [ ] Credentials are parameterized (not hardcoded)
- [ ] Error handling works as expected
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] No sensitive data in the workflow file
- [ ] Workflow executes successfully with test data

#### Submitting a Pull Request

1. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add: Brief description of changes"
   ```

2. **Push to your fork**:

   - Why you made them
   - How to test the changes
