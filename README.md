A professional template for creating well-documented n8n workflow repositories. This template provides everything you need to share your n8n workflows with the community, including automated documentation, visual diagrams, and contributor-friendly guidelines.

## Overview

This workflow does [describe what your workflow does here]. It connects [list services/integrations] to [explain the outcome or value].

### Workflow Diagram

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Trigger] --> B[Process Data]
    B --> C[Transform]
    C --> D[Output]

```

Replace the diagram above with your actual workflow visualization. Mermaid diagrams render automatically on GitHub and the documentation site.
